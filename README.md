I picked up to JS Frameworks like React way before learning to build 
webapps and sites with pure vanilla javascript, html and css.

When I decided to build my webpage to serve as reference for my projects, at first I was like: okay let's keep it simple...
then I was like: I want this Navbar on every page section - easy enough: Create a function to fetch the navbar.html, and reference it everywhere, great !

then I was like I want to keep some text static for my website, maybe as constants and then import them like I would do in React in my html Code, 
way too ardious => writing another function for fetching, let's say a description.html, the more and more features I wanted to implement, 
the more my face turned like this ðŸ™„ just to implement those ideas, that's why I simply moved to Vue3 for my Website

If you still want to build your website with pure html/css and vanillaJS, then good luck, may the holy star guide your way.


# What you can learn from this repo

- working with fetch API to load HTML files
-  stuff like event listeners, query selectors, etc. for manipulating the DOM

  that's basically it, the rest is basically just html and css -
  mjs is used so that we can use ecmascript features like import, export, etc.
